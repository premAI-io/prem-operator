# If you open a GitHub Issue, here is our policy

1. It must be a bug/performance issue or a feature request or a build issue or a documentation issue (for small doc fixes please send a PR instead).
2. Make sure the Issue Template is filled out.
3. The issue should be related to the repo it is created in.

Here's why we have this policy:
> We want to focus on the work that benefits the whole community, e.g., fixing bugs and adding features.

Individual support(such as questions, suggestions, or discussions) should be sought on non-GitHub channels such as our Discord, Slack, etc.
It helps us to address bugs and feature requests in a timely manner.

For enterprise or private users, please contact us([PremAI](https://premai.io)) for support directly.
