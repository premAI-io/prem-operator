We welcome all contributions, including bug fixes, feature requests, documentation improvements, and more.

## Making Contributions

### Bug Fixes

- If you've found a bug and have a fix, simply **open a Pull Request (PR)** with your changes.
- Ensure your PR description clearly describes the bug and fix. Include any relevant issue numbers.

### New Features
